# Summary

Groundwater is a very important resources
however it can bee diffucult to understand because it is hard to see and ... numerical models

The `ParFlow sandtank` is a tool tool for exploring groundwater dynamics in a visual framework. While still running advanced PDE based simultaions

It conists of dockerized workflows...


# Intended Uses
It was designed to be used by studtents and teachers but it is also a very flexible interface and our template approach will allow for future development and for users to build their own templates.

# Functionality

Paragraph about ParFlow what it is doing and how it works.
