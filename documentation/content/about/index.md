# HydroFrame Sandtank Educational Model

The ParFlow Sandtank model is a free tool that allows users to interactively simulate and visualize groundwater movement through a virtual slice of the subsurface. The app is designed to teach hydrogeology concepts. Users can adjust groundwater levels, change subsurface properties, pump groundwater, add pollutants and watch the system respond in real time.

The ParFlow Sandtank can be used as a stand-alone tool or as a supplement to existing lessons that use physical sand tank models. Refer to the User Manual and Lesson Plan Video For more information and check out the HydroFrame Education page for additional groundwater education resources.

[ParFlow Sandtank](https://github.com/hydroframe/SandTank) is an open-source web application designed by the [HydroFrame Team](https://www.hydroframe.org/) and developed by [Kitware](https://www.kitware.com/) to support increased accessibility and usability of hydrology tools for research and teaching. It uses [ParFlow](https://parflow.org/) for its simulation backend and [ParaView](https://www.paraview.org) for the data loading and processing. The communication infrastructure relies on the [ParaViewWeb](http://www.paraview.org/web/) framework.
